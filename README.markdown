html5press
==================
html5press is a theme for WordPress based on [a design by Jesper](http://jayj.dk/2009/a-free-html5-and-css3-theme/ "Original work").


Background
-----------------------------
I thought Jesper's stuff looked nice, and no WordPress theme existed yet based on his HTML5 template. So here this is.


Demo
-----------------------------
You can find [a demo here](http://html5press.com/ "HTML5Press Demo") and a screenshot below.

Notes
-----------------------------
1. __Archive Page__: There's a page template called Archives. Don't enter any page content, just title the page and select Archives for the page template. The archives will be generated automatically. See [here for an example](http://html5press.com/archives/ "HTML5Press Archives Demo").

2. __Link Post Format__: To utilize the link Post Format, simply write a new post and select "Link" for the format. You'll also need to add a custom field with the URL you want to link to. The custom field name should be __LinkFormatURL__ and the custom field value should be the URL you want to link to.

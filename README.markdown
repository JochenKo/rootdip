html5press
==================
html5press is a theme for WordPress based on [a design by Jesper](http://jayj.dk/2009/a-free-html5-and-css3-theme/ "Original work").


Background
-----------------------------
I thought Jesper's stuff looked nice, and no WordPress theme existed yet based on his HTML5 template. So here this is.


Demo
-----------------------------
You can find [a demo here](http://new.longren.org/ "HTML5Press Demo")


Notes
-----------------------------
There's a page template called Archives. Don't enter any page content, just title the page and select Archives for the page template. The archives will be generated automatically. See [here for an example](http://new.longren.org/archives/ "HTML5Press Archives Demo").

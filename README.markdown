html5press
==================
html5press is a theme for WordPress based on [a design by Jesper](http://jayj.dk/2009/a-free-html5-and-css3-theme/ "Original work").


Background
-----------------------------
I thought Jesper's stuff looked nice, and no WordPress theme existed yet based on his HTML5 template. So here this is. Really though, most of the credit goes to Jesper, without his work this theme would not exist.


Demo
-----------------------------
You can find [a demo here](http://html5press.com/ "HTML5Press Demo") and a screenshot below.

Notes
-----------------------------
1. __Archive Page__: There's a page template called Archives. Don't enter any page content, just title the page and select Archives for the page template. The archives will be generated automatically. See [here for an example](http://html5press.com/archives/ "HTML5Press Archives Demo").

2. __Link Post Format__: To utilize the link Post Format, simply write a new post and select "Link" for the format. You'll also need to add a custom field with the URL you want to link to. The custom field name should be __LinkFormatURL__ and the custom field value should be the URL you want to link to.

Other Considerations
-----------------------------
A majority of the images included in HTML5Press are from the [iconic icon set](http://somerandomdude.com/projects/iconic/ "Iconic Icons!") by [P.J. Onori](http://somerandomdude.com/ "Some Random Dude"). Images from Iconic are the tag, sticky post identifier, link post format identifier, status post format identifier, quote post format identifier and left and right arrows. I will likely use more images from Iconic as I add additional features/post formats to HTML5Press.
